# SARS-Cov-2 Analysis 

This is a set of simple sequence explorations and analysis based on the work in the Biostars handbook for coronavirus analysis.  The goal is to explore this data in an easily reproducable way with limited user input.  This is not a full analysis pipeline, nor any novel analysis that will be groundbreaking.  

## Structure

* analysis: this directory contains the analysis scripts and programs.  
* corona: Populate this with the data from biostars.  TODO: populate during setup
* setup_utils: This is a set of shell scripts to setup the environment.  
* tmp: a temporary working directory for intermediary file used in the analysis.  TODO: create this during setup
* results: where the final analysis results will go.  TODO: create this during setup
